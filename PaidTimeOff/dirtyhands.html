            <h5><strong>Verse 1: Max Donlucas</strong></h5>
                Careful I don't seem to be emotionally attached</br>
                You're putting things into motion and I'm sure that you're a catch</br>
                But I've been icing up, decided that I'd park the bus out back</br>
                It's not broken out of tokens just surface to sign the cast</br>
            <p>
                I'm doing this one for the person the sermon's directed at</br>
                Who's murmurs the one that serve you and ferments your itch to act</br>
                Should currently be your purpose the first to pop from the stack</br>
                Protagonist of the plot you've driven out till fade to black</br>
                But treated lastly</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Literally, can't run that past me</br>
                Astounded as the sound that still I have not found me</br>
                Figurative, figure it for crying out loudly</br>
                You have a syndrome of impostor? But I've been had crowned king</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Why don't I give myself a chance?</br>
                It's obvious it's not working let me make a change of plans</br>
                Cause doubts been dating honest with no contest wears the pants</br>
                And shouting at your problems sets us off where we began</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Enough of saying I can't, we live but one lifespan</br>
                With luck, so roll the die</br>
                And if I land it hope my wish be granted we all yearn to fly</br>
            </p>

            <h5><strong>Verse 2: Michael Yates</strong></h5>
            Sabrina the teenage witch
            </p>
            <p>
                You know</br>
                When every letter's a nail</br>
                But still I write these words</br>
                You'd think that this wouldn't help</br>
                I stand with all I've wrote</br>
                S'long as I got Mary's to hail</br>
                I'll sing this hymn at church</br>
                I think for what it's worth</br>
                You know</br>
            </p>
            </br>
            <p>
            <h5><strong>Chorus 1:</strong></h5>
            In the room, in the couch, in the passenger seat</br>
            Romanticizing hypotheticals that flow in between</br>
            Is there no reason to fret</br>
            My hope a meaningless sigh</br>
            No more curbside kindness from the boys who stash</br>
            The most indelible rhymes</br>
            Secret beneath the mattress</br>
            Patiently awaiting for shotty to come and match it</br>
            Conversation a habit</br>
            Lonnie kissing on cashius</br>
            Rolling round on the canvas what you think that means?</br>
            </p>
            </br>
            <p>
            <h5><strong>Verse 3: Michael Yates</strong></h5>
            I think it means bad timing a bad polaroid picture</br>
            Ceiling fixture improved the lighting</br>
            Further defined my features maybe then you could see me</br>
            Just clearly enough to bite me</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't feign interest</br>
                I remain optimistic in spite of my disposition</br>
                The long absence of love</br>
                Painstakingly driven</br>
                Old analogy huh, every comparison stricken</br>
                With an ugly aroma that is inherently distant</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Clutching figures that escape from my eye piece</br>
                Where is my wifey?</br>
                Where are my Nike's?</br>
                Body fucking banging got a cheetah print psyche,</br>
                Bet I'm the only homie that'll sing it to her nicely.</br>
            </p>
            </br>
            <p>
            <h5><strong>Verse 4: Max Donlucas</strong></h5>
            Timing's more than just a unique unit of measure</br>
            It's riding out the current looking forward to have met you</br>
            Really only have a problem if you think I regret</br>
            Truth be spoken and I openly express my content to</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Note you're happy not just slightly look,</br>
                You radiate brightly</br>
                Shorter hair than shoulder length like school,</br>
                That takes me back, high key</br>
                All the time you've spent away from San Jose's done you nicely</br>
                Wouldn't change it for a second</br>
                Even if you had asked please</br>
            </p>
