                What am I lacking</br>
                How do you take your coffee?</br>
                I'm in love with the sweetest</br>
                Candy patty mint jaw piece</br>
                Dressing up for a reason and</br>
                Cooking dinner for two plates</br>
                Momma's homemade chicken</br>
                Mashies gravy and fruitcake</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't keep it to yourself</br>
                And not tell me about your toothache</br>
                And baby's yesterday heart brake</br>
                And how you're stronger now</br>
                Steady cruising, black emphatic two piece</br>
                M.D. Marten booties, acting like she barely knew me</br>

                Scratching surface</br>
                Ready want to learn 'bout you daily</br>
                Wavy way you wear your hair</br>
                The braided tail's got me lately</br>
                Practice cursive,</br>
                Mailed it uppercase every version</br>
                Lost if gifted or cursed</br>
                When sentenced coffins or worse</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                You know</br>
                When every letter's a nail</br>
                But still I write these words</br>
                You'd think that this wouldn't help</br>
                I stand with all I've wrote</br>
                S'long as I got Mary's to hail</br>
                I'll sing this hymn at church</br>
                I think for what it's worth</br>
                You know</br>

                <h5><strong>Chorus 1:</strong></h5>
                In the room, in the couch, in the passenger seat</br>
                Romanticizing hypotheticals that flow in between</br>
                Is there no reason to fret</br>
                My hope a meaningless sigh</br>
                No more curbside kindness from the boys who stash</br>
                The most indelible rhymes</br>
                Secret beneath the mattress</br>
                Patiently awaiting for shotty to come and match it</br>
                Conversation a habit</br>
                Lonnie kissing on cashius</br>
                Rolling round on the canvas what you think that means?</br>
            </p>
            </br>
            <p>
                <h5><strong>Verse 3: Michael Yates</strong></h5>
                I think it means bad timing a bad polaroid picture</br>
                Ceiling fixture improved the lighting</br>
                Further defined my features maybe then you could see me</br>
                Just clearly enough to bite me</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't feign interest</br>
                I remain optimistic in spite of my disposition</br>
                The long absence of love</br>
                Painstakingly driven</br>
                Old analogy huh, every comparison stricken</br>
                With an ugly aroma that is inherently distant</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Clutching figures that escape from my eye piece</br>
                Where is my wifey?</br>
                Where are my Nike's?</br>
                Body fucking banging got a cheetah print psyche,</br>
                Bet I'm the only homie that'll sing it to her nicely.</br>
            </p>

                <h5><strong>Verse 4: Max Donlucas</strong></h5>
                Timing's more than just a unique unit of measure</br>
                It's riding out the current looking forward to have met you</br>
                Really only have a problem if you think I regret</br>
                Truth be spoken and I openly express my content to</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Note you're happy not just slightly look,</br>
                You radiate brightly</br>
                Shorter hair than shoulder length like school,</br>
                That takes me back, high key</br>
                All the time you've spent away from San Jose's done you nicely</br>
                Wouldn't change it for a second</br>
                Even if you had asked please</br>
            </p>
