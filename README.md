# paidtimeoff-website

This project is a website for a music group. Eventually I'd like the website to have a number of functionalities.
The main being a source of news/information about the group as well as a place to view all the work being done by them.
That includes music, lyrics, videos, photographs, podcasts, merchandise etc.

So far a basic skeleton has been built, navigation bar, as well as two lyric pages.

TODO:
Layout basic index page.
Finish lyric pages and add functionality for meaning behind certain stanzas like Genis.com has it.
Add images.
Create and add logo.
Fix twitter and youtube links in the contact section.
